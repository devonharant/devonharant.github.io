            My name is Devon Harant, I am a current Computer Science student at the University of South Carolina in Columbia South Carolina.
            I have an interest in software engineering and game design as well as a bit of new-found interest in AI. I aspire to learn from every experience
            and apply my knowledgeset to any situation I can in order to learn and grow. I am currently looking for employment opportunities either in 
            the Northern Virginia, DC-Metro area or the Charlotte-Metro area! Concerning hobbies I collect vinyl and love to play video games and occasionally stream on Twitch!
            I also love technology, especially emerging technology, especially in terms of PC building and computing. On top of all of that, I am an avid Dead-Head!

        <p>
            During my time at U of SC I have learned a multitude of topics and languages including Java, C++, SQL, some Python, MATLAB, algorithms and data structures, basic networking, basic network socket programming,
            software development, source control, linear algebra, and operating systems to name a few. I keep my LinkedIn up-to-date with classes I have taken throughout my college career. On my own
            I have learned the basics of GOLang, JavaScript, SQL, and even AWS (although the very basics of AWS). I have even done a few significant projects during my time at UofSC that I will mention later on.
